CONTEXT UPDATE: Entity Resolution Priority 3.5
================================================================================

Hi! You're working on PLAN_ENTITY-RESOLUTION-REFACTOR.md Priority 3.5.

While you were working, significant methodology improvements were completed 
including a new resume protocol. This affects how you should proceed.

PLEASE READ THIS FILE COMPLETELY BEFORE CONTINUING:
📄 HANDOFF_ENTITY-RESOLUTION-RESUME.md

Key points:
1. Priority 3.5 appears in TWO places in the PLAN - this is CORRECT (not duplication)
   - Lines 367-413 = WHAT to do (the achievements)  
   - Lines 581-621 = WHY it was added (the decision log)
   
2. New files created:
   - IMPLEMENTATION_RESUME.md (resume protocol - new!)
   - EXECUTION_ANALYSIS_ENTITY-RESOLUTION-BUGS.md (renamed from CRITICAL_ANALYSIS)
   - Enhanced naming guidance in IMPLEMENTATION_START_POINT.md

3. Important naming rules to follow:
   ✅ Create: SUBPLAN_ENTITY-RESOLUTION-REFACTOR_XX.md
   ✅ Create: EXECUTION_TASK_ENTITY-RESOLUTION-REFACTOR_XX_01.md
   ❌ NEVER: PLAN_UPDATE_*, *-STATUS, *-SUMMARY, *-COMPLIANCE files

BEFORE creating ANY more files:
1. Read HANDOFF_ENTITY-RESOLUTION-RESUME.md (complete context)
2. Check file names you've created (verify they follow naming convention)
3. Read IMPLEMENTATION_RESUME.md (new resume protocol)
4. Tell the user what files you've created so far
5. Ask for confirmation before proceeding

The work you're doing (Priority 3.5) is critical and correct - we just need to 
ensure you're following the new protocol.

Questions? Ask before creating more files.
