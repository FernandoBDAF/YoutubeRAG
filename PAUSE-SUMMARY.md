## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### Priorities Completed: 0, 1, 2, 3 (All Critical)

**Priority 0 - Stability & Reproducibility** ✅
- Achievement 0.1: Stable Community IDs (hash-based, deterministic)
- Achievement 0.2: Run Metadata & Provenance (params_hash, graph_signature)
- Achievement 0.3: Graph Drift Detection (prevents stale communities)
- Achievement 0.4: source_count Accuracy (Not Applicable - reviewed and confirmed)

**Priority 1 - Ontology Integration & Quality** ✅
- Achievement 1.1-1.2: Ontology-Aware Edge Weighting (canonical boosts, type-pair bonuses)
- Achievement 1.3: Community Size Management (split oversized, merge micro)
- Achievement 1.4: Quality Metrics Persistence (graphrag_metrics collection)

**Priority 2 - Intelligent Summarization** ✅
- Achievement 2.1: Exact Token Counting (tiktoken integration)
- Achievement 2.2: Centrality-Aware Summarization (PageRank-based selection)
- Achievement 2.3: Predicate Profile Enhancement (top predicates in prompts)

**Priority 3 - Multi-Resolution & Detection** ✅
- Achievement 3.1: Multi-Resolution Louvain (multiple scales)
- Achievement 3.2: Leiden Detector (NetworkX/graspologic fallback)
- Achievement 3.3: Label Propagation Baseline (fast alternative)
- Achievement 3.4: Quality Gates (modularity, coverage, size validation)

## 📝 Documentation Updated

✅ PLAN_COMMUNITY-DETECTION-REFACTOR.md - Updated with Achievement 0.4 status  
✅ ACTIVE_PLANS.md - Marked as paused, updated statistics  
✅ CHANGELOG.md - Added comprehensive completion entry  
✅ Archive created with INDEX.md and completion summary

## 🎯 What's Next (When Resuming)

**Remaining Priorities**: 4, 5, 6, 7

**Recommended Next Steps**:
1. **Priority 7** - Expand test coverage (7 → 50+ tests)
2. **Priority 4** - Advanced detection features (Infomap, Ensemble, Incremental)
3. **Priority 5** - Advanced summarization (Embedding-guided, Predicate-topic, Title generation)

**To Resume**:
1. Follow `IMPLEMENTATION_RESUME.md` protocol
2. Review `PLAN_COMMUNITY-DETECTION-REFACTOR.md` in root
3. Review archive at `documentation/archive/community-detection-partial-nov2025/`
4. Select next achievement
5. Create SUBPLAN and continue
