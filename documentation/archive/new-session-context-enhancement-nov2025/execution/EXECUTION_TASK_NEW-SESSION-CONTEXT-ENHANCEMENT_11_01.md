## 📖 What We're Building

Enhancing PLAN_FILE-MOVING-OPTIMIZATION.md "Context for LLM Execution" section with comprehensive project context and explicit archive instructions. Adding Project Context subsection with project structure, domain knowledge, conventions, related work, and archive location/instructions.

**Success**: PLAN enhanced with project context, archive location explicit, archive instructions clear, all verification passes.

## 🧪 Validation Approach (Documentation Work)

**Validation Method**:
- Completeness check (all required elements added)
- Structure validation (content integrates well)
- Review against requirements (Achievement 1.1 met)

**Verification Commands**:
```bash
# Verify PLAN file exists and updated
ls PLAN_FILE-MOVING-OPTIMIZATION.md

# Check for Project Context subsection
grep -A 10 "Project Context" PLAN_FILE-MOVING-OPTIMIZATION.md

# Check for archive location
grep "Archive Location\|archive location" PLAN_FILE-MOVING-OPTIMIZATION.md

# Check for archive instructions
grep -i "how to archive\|archive structure" PLAN_FILE-MOVING-OPTIMIZATION.md
```

## 🔄 Iteration Log

### Iteration 1: Read Current Context Section
**Date**: 2025-11-08 01:00 UTC  
**Test Run**: Review existing "Context for LLM Execution" section  
**Result**: Pass  
**Action**: Read current section to understand structure and integration points  
**Learning**: Current section has 5 numbered items, need to add Project Context as item 3 or new subsection  
**Progress Check**: Making progress: Yes  
**Next Step**: Add Project Context subsection

---

### Iteration 2: Add Project Context Subsection
**Date**: 2025-11-08 01:02 UTC  
**Test Run**: Add Project Context subsection with project structure, domain, conventions  
**Result**: Pass  
**Action**: Added comprehensive Project Context subsection after item 2  
**Fix Applied**:
- File: PLAN_FILE-MOVING-OPTIMIZATION.md
- Added: Project Context subsection with project structure, domain knowledge, key directories, conventions, related work
- Rationale: Provides LLM with essential project knowledge to prevent procedural errors

**Learning**: Project context must be specific and actionable, not generic  
**Progress Check**: Making progress: Yes  
**Next Step**: Add archive location and instructions

---

### Iteration 3: Add Archive Location and Instructions
**Date**: 2025-11-08 01:04 UTC  
**Test Run**: Add explicit archive location and archiving instructions  
**Result**: Pass  
**Action**: Added archive location explicitly and "How to Archive" instructions  
**Fix Applied**:
- File: PLAN_FILE-MOVING-OPTIMIZATION.md
- Added: Archive location explicitly stated in Project Context
- Added: Archive structure requirements (subplans/, execution/)
- Added: "How to Archive" instructions (deferred archiving policy)
- Rationale: Archive location must be prominent to prevent mismatches

**Learning**: Archive location must be explicit and prominent, not just in "Archive Location" section  
**Progress Check**: Making progress: Yes  
**Next Step**: Verify integration and completeness

---

### Iteration 4: Verification
**Date**: 2025-11-08 01:05 UTC  
**Test Run**: Run all verification commands  
**Result**: Pass  
**Action**: Verified all required elements are present and integrated well  
**Verification Results**:
- ✅ Project Context subsection added
- ✅ Archive location explicitly stated
- ✅ Archive structure requirements included
- ✅ "How to Archive" instructions included
- ✅ Content integrates well with existing section

**Learning**: Verification essential to ensure completeness  
**Progress Check**: Complete: Yes  
**Next Step**: Complete EXECUTION_TASK

## 📚 Learning Summary

**Technical Learnings**:
- Project context must be specific to the PLAN (not generic)
- Archive location must be explicit and prominent in context section
- Content must integrate seamlessly with existing structure

**Process Learnings**:
- Systematic approach (read → add context → add archive → verify) works well
- Verification commands essential to catch missing elements
- Integration is key - new content must fit existing structure

**Mistakes Made & Recovered**:
- None - work was straightforward documentation enhancement
