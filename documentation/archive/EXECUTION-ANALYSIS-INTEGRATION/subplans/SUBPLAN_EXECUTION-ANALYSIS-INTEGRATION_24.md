# SUBPLAN: Achievement 2.4 - Create Process Analysis Template

**Parent PLAN**: PLAN_EXECUTION-ANALYSIS-INTEGRATION.md  
**Achievement**: 2.4 - Create Process Analysis Template  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Created**: 2025-11-08

## 🎯 Objective

Create comprehensive template for Process & Workflow Analysis EXECUTION_ANALYSIS documents (`LLM/templates/EXECUTION_ANALYSIS-PROCESS-ANALYSIS-TEMPLATE.md`) with all required sections, metadata fields, structure guidelines, and usage examples.

**Value**: Standardizes process analysis creation, ensures consistency, and provides clear guidance for when and how to document process issues, workflow problems, and optimization opportunities.

## 📦 Deliverables

1. **`LLM/templates/EXECUTION_ANALYSIS-PROCESS-ANALYSIS-TEMPLATE.md`**:
   - Header metadata section (Purpose, Date, Status, Related, Category)
   - Problem Statement section
   - Analysis section
   - Recommendations section
   - Implementation Plan section
   - Usage guidelines
   - Example from existing process analysis

2. **Template Quality**:
   - Clear section descriptions
   - Placeholder text for guidance
   - Links to guide and examples
   - Ready for immediate use

## 🔄 Approach

### Phase 1: Review Existing Process Analyses (10 min)

**Step 1.1**: Read example process analysis
- Review `EXECUTION_ANALYSIS_RESUME-PROTOCOL-GAPS.md` or similar
- Identify common structure patterns
- Note required vs optional sections

**Step 1.2**: Extract structure patterns
- Header metadata format
- Problem Statement structure
- Analysis organization
- Recommendations format
- Implementation Plan structure

### Phase 2: Create Template (15 min)

**Step 2.1**: Create template structure
- Header with metadata fields
- All required sections with descriptions
- Placeholder text for guidance
- Section ordering and hierarchy

**Step 2.2**: Add usage guidelines
- When to use this template
- How to fill each section
- Best practices
- Links to guide

**Step 2.3**: Add example
- Extract example from existing process analysis
- Show completed template structure
- Link to full example in archive

### Phase 3: Verify and Link (5 min)

**Step 3.1**: Verify template completeness
- All required sections present
- Metadata fields documented
- Links work correctly

**Step 3.2**: Link from guide
- Ensure EXECUTION-ANALYSIS-GUIDE.md references template
- Verify consistency

## 📝 Notes

**Implementation Focus**:
- Make template practical and actionable
- Include clear guidance for each section
- Use real example from archive
- Link to related resources

**Template Structure** (from guide):
- Header Metadata (Purpose, Date, Status, Related, Category)
- Problem Statement (what's the process issue, impact, symptoms)
- Analysis (investigation, root cause, contributing factors)
- Recommendations (process improvements, workflow changes)
- Implementation Plan (steps to improve process)

**Common Use Cases**:
- Process issues identified (workflow friction)
- Performance problems found
- Methodology gap discovered
- Workflow optimization needed
- Process bottleneck analysis
