## 🔄 Approach

### Phase 1: Review Existing Planning & Strategy Analyses (10 min)

**Step 1.1**: Read example planning analysis
- Review `EXECUTION_ANALYSIS_PLAN-COMPLETION-VERIFICATION-GAP.md` or similar
- Identify common structure patterns
- Note required vs optional sections

**Step 1.2**: Extract structure patterns
- Header metadata format
- Current State structure
- Analysis organization (options, trade-offs, evaluation)
- Recommendation format
- Next Steps structure

### Phase 2: Create Template (15 min)

**Step 2.1**: Create template structure
- Header with metadata fields
- All required sections with descriptions
- Placeholder text for guidance
- Section ordering and hierarchy

**Step 2.2**: Add usage guidelines
- When to use this template
- How to fill each section
- Best practices
- Links to guide

**Step 2.3**: Add example
- Extract example from existing planning analysis
- Show completed template structure
- Link to full example in archive

### Phase 3: Verify and Link (5 min)

**Step 3.1**: Verify template completeness
- All required sections present
- Metadata fields documented
- Links work correctly

**Step 3.2**: Link from guide
- Ensure EXECUTION-ANALYSIS-GUIDE.md references template
- Verify consistency

## 📝 Notes

**Implementation Focus**:
- Make template practical and actionable
- Include clear guidance for each section
- Use real example from archive
- Link to related resources

**Template Structure** (from guide):
- Header Metadata (Purpose, Date, Status, Related, Category)
- Current State (what exists now, context)
- Analysis (options considered, trade-offs, evaluation)
- Recommendation (preferred approach with rationale)
- Next Steps (how to proceed, often leads to PLAN creation)

**Common Use Cases**:
- Before creating new PLAN (strategic decision needed)
- Design choice requires analysis
- Multiple approaches to evaluate
- Planning question arises
- Strategy decision needed
