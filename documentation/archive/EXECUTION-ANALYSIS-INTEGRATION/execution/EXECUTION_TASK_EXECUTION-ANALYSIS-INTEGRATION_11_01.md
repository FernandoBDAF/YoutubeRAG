## 📚 Learning Summary

**Key Learnings**:

1. **Section Already Existed**: The EXECUTION_ANALYSIS section was already comprehensive, so this was an enhancement task rather than creation.

2. **Archive Structure Alignment**: Needed to update examples to match actual archive structure created in Achievement 0.1 (methodology-review vs completion-review).

3. **Template References**: Added template references for all 5 categories, noting they will be created in Priority 2 achievements.

4. **Automation Scripts**: Documented 4 automation scripts that will be created in Priority 3 achievements.

5. **Integration Points**: Added clear integration guidance with END_POINT, START_POINT, and RESUME protocols.

**What Worked Well**:
- Existing section was well-structured, only needed enhancements
- Clear categories and triggers already documented
- Easy to add template and automation references

**What Could Be Improved**:
- Templates and scripts are referenced but not yet created (will be done in future achievements)
- Could add more examples from archive
