   - When to create analyses (blockers, methodology gaps, quality issues, strategic decisions, post-mortems)
   - Quick decision tree for when to create analysis
   - Links to templates and methodology guide
   - Archive location reference
4. Added analysis review step to RESUME:
   - Added to "Understand Context" checklist: "Review relevant EXECUTION_ANALYSIS documents"
   - Guidance on finding analyses (by feature, category, INDEX.md)
   - Added detailed section in "Select Next Achievement" with examples
   - Links to archive structure
5. Verified integration is natural and helpful:
