3. Created comprehensive template with:
   - Header metadata section (Purpose, Date, Status, Related, Category)
   - Problem Statement (description, symptoms, impact, when it occurs)
   - Analysis (investigation, root cause, contributing factors, evidence)
   - Recommendations (process improvements, workflow changes)
   - Implementation Plan (steps with dependencies and effort)
