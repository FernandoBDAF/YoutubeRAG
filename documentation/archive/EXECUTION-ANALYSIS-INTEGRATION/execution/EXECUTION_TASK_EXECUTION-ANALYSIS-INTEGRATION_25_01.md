## 📋 Iteration Log

### Iteration 1: Template Creation (Complete)

**Goal**: Create EXECUTION_ANALYSIS-PLANNING-STRATEGY-TEMPLATE.md

**Actions**:
1. Reviewed existing planning & strategy analysis examples (`EXECUTION_ANALYSIS_PLAN-COMPLETION-VERIFICATION-GAP.md`, `EXECUTION_ANALYSIS_PROMPT-AUTOMATION-STRATEGY.md`)
2. Extracted structure patterns (Current State → Analysis → Recommendation → Next Steps)
3. Created comprehensive template with:
   - Header metadata section (Purpose, Date, Status, Related, Category)
   - Current State (what exists now, context, related work)
   - Analysis (options considered with pros/cons, trade-offs evaluation)
   - Recommendation (preferred approach with rationale, benefits, risks)
   - Next Steps (immediate actions, planning if leads to PLAN, follow-up)
   - Related Analyses section (for linking)
   - Usage guidelines and best practices
   - Links to guide, archive, and START_POINT protocol
4. Added placeholder text for guidance
5. Included example reference
6. Linked to guide, archive, and START_POINT protocol

**Result**: ✅ Comprehensive planning & strategy template created
