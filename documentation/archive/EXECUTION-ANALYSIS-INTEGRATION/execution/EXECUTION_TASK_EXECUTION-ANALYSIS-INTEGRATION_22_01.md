## 📋 Iteration Log

### Iteration 1: Template Creation (Complete)

**Goal**: Create EXECUTION_ANALYSIS-METHODOLOGY-REVIEW-TEMPLATE.md

**Actions**:
1. Reviewed existing methodology review example (`EXECUTION_ANALYSIS_METHODOLOGY-REVIEW.md`)
2. Extracted structure patterns (Executive Summary → Findings → Recommendations → Action Items)
3. Created comprehensive template with:
   - Header metadata section (Purpose, Date, Status, Related PLAN(s), Category)
   - Executive Summary (high-level findings, key issues, status)
   - Execution Sample Analysis (if reviewing specific PLANs)
   - Performance Analysis (What Worked Well, What Didn't Work Well)
   - Success Metrics (adoption, quality, documentation)
   - Key Findings (successes, issues, insights)
   - Analysis In Progress (if applicable)
   - Recommendations (methodology improvements, template updates, protocol enhancements)
   - Action Items (immediate, short-term, long-term)
   - Related Analyses section (for linking)
   - Conclusion (summary, status, next steps)
   - Usage guidelines and best practices
   - Links to guide and examples
4. Added placeholder text for guidance
5. Included example reference
6. Linked to guide, archive, and END_POINT protocol

**Result**: ✅ Comprehensive methodology review template created

## 💡 Learning Summary

**What Worked Well**:
1. Used real example as reference for structure
2. Included all required sections from guide
3. Added helpful placeholder text and organization
4. Provided clear usage guidelines
