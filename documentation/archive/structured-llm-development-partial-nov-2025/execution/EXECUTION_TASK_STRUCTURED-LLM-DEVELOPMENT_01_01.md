# EXECUTION_TASK: Create IMPLEMENTATION_START_POINT.md

**Subplan**: SUBPLAN_STRUCTURED-LLM-DEVELOPMENT_01.md  
**Mother Plan**: PLAN_STRUCTURED-LLM-DEVELOPMENT.md  
**Achievement**: 1.1 - Entry Point Document Exists  
**Execution Number**: 01 (first attempt)  
**Started**: November 5, 2025  
**Status**: In Progress

---

## 📖 What We're Building

Creating `IMPLEMENTATION_START_POINT.md` - the comprehensive entry point document that enables anyone (human or LLM) to start new work using the structured methodology.

**Success**: Self-contained guide covering all document types, workflows, and decision points.

---

## 🧪 Test Creation Phase

**Note**: This is documentation work, not code. "Tests" are:

- Completeness check (all required sections)
- Self-containment check (can be used standalone)
- LLM comprehension check (clear for LLM to parse)

**Validation Approach**:

- Review against SUBPLAN requirements
- Check all 12 required sections present
- Verify examples included
- Ensure decision trees present

## 🔄 Iteration Log

### Iteration 1: Initial Document Creation

**Date**: November 5, 2025  
**Action**: Creating IMPLEMENTATION_START_POINT.md with all required sections  
**Approach**: Comprehensive single-pass creation, then iterate on feedback  
**Sections to Include**:

1. Purpose & Overview
2. Methodology Overview
3. How to Create a PLAN
4. How to Create a SUBPLAN
5. How to Create an EXECUTION_TASK
6. Dynamic Achievement Management
7. Test-Driven Development Workflow
8. Preventing Circular Debugging
9. Templates and Tools
10. Examples
11. Quick Decision Trees
12. Next Steps

**Learning to Incorporate**:

- Learnings from PLAN_STRUCTURED-LLM-DEVELOPMENT creation
- Meta-insight: plan creation itself is iterative
- Common mistakes (listing subplans in PLAN, populating backlog, etc.)
- Self-contained requirement for LLM execution

**Result**: ✅ Complete

**Document Created**: IMPLEMENTATION_START_POINT.md (~460 lines)

**Learning**:

- Self-contained documents need comprehensive coverage
- Examples from this PLAN itself are valuable
- Decision trees help clarify when to use what
- Meta-insights (plan creation is iterative) make it richer

---

## 📚 Learning Summary

**Technical**:

- Self-contained means standalone (no external refs needed)
- Examples make abstract concepts concrete
