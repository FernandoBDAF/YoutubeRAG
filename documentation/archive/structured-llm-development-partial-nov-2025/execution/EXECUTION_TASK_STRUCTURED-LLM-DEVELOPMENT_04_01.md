### Iteration 1: Add Structured Development Methodology Section

**Date**: November 5, 2025  
**Action**: Adding new major section to DOCUMENTATION-PRINCIPLES-AND-PROCESS.md  
**Approach**: Insert after core principles, before folder structure

**Sections Being Added**:

1. "Structured Development Methodology" (new major section)
   - Three-tier hierarchy
   - Document types
   - Workflow overview
2. Updates to "Documentation Lifecycle"
3. Updates to archiving sections

**Learning to Apply**:

- Don't break existing content
- Integrate, don't just append
- Maintain document flow
- Cross-reference appropriately

**Result**: ✅ Complete

**Changes Made**:

1. Added "Structured Development Methodology" section (120 lines) after Core Principles
2. Updated header with entry/exit point cross-references
3. Updated Root Directory section to list methodology docs
4. Updated "After Feature Complete" to reference IMPLEMENTATION_END_POINT.md
5. Updated archiving section with PLAN archive structure

**Learning**:
