## 🔄 Iteration Log

### Iteration 1: Integrate Feedback and Milestone Content

**Date**: 2025-11-05 21:00 UTC  
**Action**: Moved all content from separate files into PLAN  
**Changes**:

1. Added "Milestone" section to PLAN (moved from MILESTONE-STRUCTURED-METHODOLOGY-FOUNDATION.md)
2. Added "Feedback Analysis & Improvements" section to PLAN (moved from FEEDBACK-ANALYSIS_STRUCTURED-METHODOLOGY.md)
3. Updated Achievement Addition Log with 6 discovered sub-achievements
4. Deleted 4 non-conforming files

**Files Deleted** (non-conforming):

- STRUCTURED-METHODOLOGY-FOUNDATION-COMPLETE.md
- MILESTONE-STRUCTURED-METHODOLOGY-FOUNDATION.md
- FEEDBACK-ANALYSIS_STRUCTURED-METHODOLOGY.md
- PLAN_STRUCTURED-LLM-DEVELOPMENT_FINAL-STATUS.md

**Learning**:

- We violated our own methodology by creating separate status files
- User caught it immediately
- Correct approach: integrate into PLAN as sections
- This demonstrates the importance of following your own rules!

**Progress**: ✅ Complete - All content now in PLAN, structure clean

## 📚 Learning Summary

**Process**:

- Feedback loops catch violations (user caught non-conforming files)
- PLANs are living - can add sections for milestone, feedback, etc.
- Follow your own methodology (we learned this the hard way!)

**Meta**:

- Even creating the methodology requires following it
- Non-conforming files are technical debt immediately
- Integration > separation for status/analysis content
