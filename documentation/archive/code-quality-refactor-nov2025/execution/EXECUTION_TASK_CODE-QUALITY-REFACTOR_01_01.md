## Iteration Log

### Iteration 1

**Date**: November 6, 2025  
**Task**: Research existing patterns and create methodology document

**Actions**:
1. ✅ Reviewed MASTER-PLAN.md for library vision (error_handling, metrics, retry, validation, etc.)
2. ✅ Reviewed existing libraries structure in `core/libraries/` (found 18+ libraries, some not used yet)
3. ✅ Reviewed clean code principles and anti-patterns from codebase analysis
4. ✅ Created comprehensive methodology document: `documentation/guides/CODE-REVIEW-METHODOLOGY.md`

**Deliverables Created**:
- ✅ Review methodology document (comprehensive, 500+ lines)
- ✅ Findings template (embedded in methodology)
- ✅ Decision framework for library extraction (embedded in methodology)
- ✅ Priority framework (P0-P4 with impact/effort matrix)
- ✅ Pattern identification checklist (10 categories)
- ✅ Quality metrics and targets

**Key Components**:
- Step-by-step review process (5 steps)
- File-by-file review checklist
- Pattern identification checklist (10 categories: error handling, LLM, DB, validation, etc.)
- Code quality assessment criteria
- Anti-pattern detection guide
- Library extraction decision framework
- Priority matrix (impact vs. effort)
- Findings template
- Quality metrics and targets

**Progress**: ✅ Complete

**Learning**: 
- Many libraries already exist but aren't being used (from deep review findings)
- Need to focus on applying existing libraries first, then creating new ones
- Methodology should emphasize checking existing libraries before creating new ones

**Next Steps**: Ready for Achievement 0.2 (Current State Analyzed)
