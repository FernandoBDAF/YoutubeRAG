            "• Structure: Produce coherent paragraphs with natural flow.\n"
            "• Integrity: Preserve all code, formulas, numbers, and symbols exactly as written.\n"

            "2- Remove disfluencies and filler words ('uh', 'um', 'you know') and single-word interjections ('ok', 'yeah', 'morning'), and stage cues ([APPLAUSE], [MUSIC], etc.).\n"
            "3- Preserve speaker cues: if names exist, keep them (e.g., '[John Doe]: ...'); if missing, retain placeholders like '[Speaker 1]: ...'. "
            "Always use brackets and colons.\n"
            "4- Preserve all technical, code, and math expressions exactly as given — do not alter symbols, equations, or code blocks.\n"
            "5- Rebuild paragraphs for natural readability: group sentences by topic or idea. "
            "Aim for 6-10 sentences per paragraph when possible; insert double newlines between paragraphs.\n"
            "6- Keep the same language as the input. Do not translate.\n"
            "7- Output ONLY the final cleaned text — plain UTF-8 with no markdown, no JSON, and no comments.\n\n"
            "EXAMPLE OUTPUT (abbreviated):\n"
            "[Speaker 1]: Big-O notation describes the asymptotic behavior of algorithms. "
            "It measures how runtime grows as input size increases.\n\n"
